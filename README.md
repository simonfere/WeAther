# This is WeAther 1.0
This app was made to test my habilities of JavaScript . It's quite simple: it shows you the weather of the day and a picture of it. 


## Pure API work

I worked with the OpenWeatherMap's API. As you can see, the pictures are picked from the API; that means low quality, so it'll be improved in future versions.

## Best way to experience

This version is focused on the smartphone view of the app.

### Enjoy and stay safe!
