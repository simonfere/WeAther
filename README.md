## Day 1

First commit, page design sketch and API key setting.

## Day 2

Date system with JavaScript, some testing with the API and formatting.

## Day 3

Removed all except the first day, will add later. Some problems at the start, when no city given it keeps blank. API async function done, event listener for the form done. Alert when the city doesn't exist.
